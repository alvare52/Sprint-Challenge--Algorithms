#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Logarithmic O(log n) 


b) Linearithmic O(n log n)


c) Constant O(1) - Runtime is not affected by input size

## Exercise II

    Runtime Complexity - Constant O(1)
    
Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.
